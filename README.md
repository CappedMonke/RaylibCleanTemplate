## The cleanest of all clean Raylib templates.

Dependencies:
- Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop Development with C++ enabled)

The Linker was configured to link all necessary libraries so you don't have to do it.
The Linker was also configured to hide the console on Release-Builds.
Visual Studio was configured to put builds and intermediate files into an better organized folder structure.

For the best experience with VS I would advise to enable "Show All Files" in the Solution Explorer window. 
It looks like an icon with multiple rectangles stacked on each other.

For my part, you can use this template as you wish. Make sure to also read the raylib copyright ([it's basically open source](https://www.raylib.com/license.html)).
