## The cleanest of all clean Raylib templates.

This template is perfect for programming beginners that want a clean environment and not dozens of files in their directory. <br/>

What you need:
- Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop Development with C++ enabled)

The linker was configured to link all necessary libraries so you don't have to. <br/>
The linker was also configured to hide the console on Release-Builds. <br/>
Visual Studio was configured to put builds and intermediate files all into one folder called "builds". <br/>

For the best experience with Visual Studio, I recommend enabling "Show All Files" in the Solution Explorer window. <br/>

After downloading/cloning the repository, you can delete the .gitignore (if you're not using git) and README.md to make it even cleaner. <br/>
If you want to rename the whole project, follow [these simple instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-rename-solution-project-visual-studio-/). Shouldn't take you more than 2 minutes. <br/>

For my part, you can use this template as you wish. Make sure to also read the raylib copyright ([it's basically open source](https://www.raylib.com/license.html)). <br/>
