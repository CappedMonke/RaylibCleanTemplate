## The cleanest of all clean Raylib templates.

This is perfect for programming beginners that want a clean environment and not dozens of files in their directory. <br/>

What you need:
- Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 (Desktop Development with C++ enabled)

The Linker was configured to link all necessary libraries so you don't have to do it. <br/>
The Linker was also configured to hide the console on Release-Builds. <br/>
Visual Studio was configured to put builds and intermediate files into an better organized folder structure. <br/>

For the best experience with VS I would advise to enable "Show All Files" in the Solution Explorer window. <br/>
It looks like an icon with multiple rectangles stacked on each other. <br/>

For my part, you can use this template as you wish. Make sure to also read the raylib copyright ([it's basically open source](https://www.raylib.com/license.html)). <br/>
If you want to rename the whole project, follow [these simple instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-rename-solution-project-visual-studio-/). Shouldn't take you more than 2 minutes. <br/>
